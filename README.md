# finit
I am very sick of writing boilerplate code over and over so I am making this to try and alleviate the
insane amount of effort of making new files and writing the same code.

Ah I mean, this is for *streamlining my workflow* so that I can minimise the coding process and maximise
the testing process...

## TODO
- replace memory-unsafe functions
- find the optimal way to store/access the boilerplate code blobs for each language
- add project command-line flag to allow for initialising project dir structures complete with makefiles (may not be viable for all languages)
- add command-line flag to allow for choice of c compiler (gcc, clang, ...)
